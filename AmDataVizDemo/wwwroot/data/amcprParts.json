This device has not been tested to assess the out-gassing limits of the material or their corresponding health effects.\r\n\r\nThis respirator facemask can be built of common materials plus small, easy-to-print 3D printed parts, and a small (55mm) disk of filter material. The mask conforms to the face, with the Tyvek forming an impermeable membrane, concentrating the breathing airflow through the filter housing. The filter housing is made of 2 identical 3D-printed parts that snap together over the filter and around the edge of a circular hole in the Tyvek. The filter material is a 55mm diameter disk of material (hopefully HEPA-certified) that permits sufficient airflow.\r\n\r\nThe 3D-printed parts are a quick print, using modest amounts of filament. The idea is to make lots of these parts quickly, since 3D printers are the limiting resource.\r\n\r\nThis mask is intended for emergency use during this pandemic when manufactured products are unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe following files are supplied:\r\n\r\nmaskresp40.stl --3D-print Filter Housing half, 2 of these snap together.\r\n\r\nmaskresp40loose.stl --Variant of maskresp40.stl with looser tolerances\r\n\r\nMaskPatterns.PDF --Terse instruction sheet and 4 different-sized mask patterns\r\n\r\nMaskInstructions??.PDF --Extensive illustrated instructions and discussion. This file is versioned.\r\n\r\nNoseThingy2.stl --3D-print nose-shaper part, holds wire\r\n\r\nNoseThingy.stl --Older, shorter version of NoseThingy2.stl\r\n\r\nDisk_stencil.stl --3D-print stencil for cutting filter disks (optional)\r\n\r\nPlain paper can be substituted for Tyvek, but it is not as durable. Tyvek is available as office supplies, construction material, and protective clothing. Do not print Tyvek with a laser printer. Tyvek is a trademark of DuPont.\r\n\r\nI am really interested in real-world feedback on the use of these masks, especially by clinicians, so please comment.\r\n\r\nNote that this design is also available at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4257706/\r\n\r\nThe accompanying documents (look under \"Extras\" tab) show how to make a face mask using 2 of these parts... MaskPatterns.PDF has four 2d printable patterns for paper-like materials, regular and large size, regular and longer length, MaskInstructions06,PDF has illustrated instructions. Note that DiskStencil.stl is just a round stencil for cutting out filter material to dimension. Note that NoseThingy,stl and NoseThingy2.stl are for making something to mold the mask to the nose bridge (use TPU --needs to be flexible), Then insert wires. [more detail in instrructions]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n17 April 2020 Update, files and documents all in place.\r\n\r\n18 April 2020 Update to .PDF files, minor.\r\n\r\n27 April 2020 Title, keywords, and descriptive summary changed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nOpenSCAD\r\nModel Origin \r\nCustom illustration/CAD\r\n\r\nPrinter Technology/Material \r\nMaterial Extrusion Polylactic Acid (PLA)\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nANY\r\nPrint Units \r\nmm\r\nScale At Given Print Units \r\n(already to scale)\r\nPre- and Postprocessing Instructions \r\nTwo of the maskresp40.STL are required for each mask.  Paper patterns are in file MaskPatterns.pdf, and assembly instructions are in MaskInstructions04.pdf.  Note that this file is set up to be versioned and expanded upon.  Disk_Stencil.stl is just a stecil for cutting out filter material.

This design has been featured as a cover image on the landing page of the New York Times. The rigid reusable shield can be made in mass production by laser cutting, waterjet cutting and injection molding. It can be done at a lower rate with 3-D printing. The replacement film for the shield can be mass produced by laser jet cutting and die cutting. It can be produced at home by cutting the rough geometry from any available rigid film, such as office transparencies, and creating the tab features for mounting to the frame using a standard 3-hole punch set at standard width. The team leveraged multiple rapid prototyping/manufacturing capabilities at Georgia Tech, including the Flowers Invention Studio and the Global Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI), to iterate and finalize the design directly with clinicians from Emory Hospital and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Georgia Tech has already donated 1,000 rigid frames and 5,000 disposable/reusable films to area hospitals. These facilities also are supporting rapid evaluation of material and other specification deviation requests by suppliers. Georgia Tech has provided daily production capability of up to 2,000 rigid frames per day for the rigid reusable shield and up to 3,000 disposable/reusable films per day.  Additionally, Georgia Tech has collaborated with GCMI to deploy the shield frame design to processing using injection molding. The production is a truly scalable solution that is capable on a single machine of 150,000 frames per week in its current configuration, and is scalable up to 250,000 frames per day with multi-cavity, multi-facility molding.

UD-HensNest's original design incorporated a snap ring system that was improperly scaled at the time. I recreated the ring to incorporate a couple upgrades for different scenarios. I increased the size of the nib on both rings and then created two more with an overall longer lip along the z-axis. I also created a \"Ring Only\" version which I recommend for general use. I optimized the geometry of the ring to print best using a .4mm nozzle at .32mm layer height.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nThis setup makes it easier to breathe as it provides more surface area by creating a tent over your face. I'll leave the medical benefits to having a \"tented\" face covering up to the medical professionals but it would be worth checking both 6markfuller and UD-HensNests submissions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPrint one S/M/L sized mask, ring, and tent per person. Attach UD-HensNest's \"squigglyspider\" to one of 6markfuller's masks by placing the nibs of the spider through the hole on the anchor points. Then place a filter medium over the ring and through the hole on the squigglyspider. Use whatever rubber-band/string material you have to fasten it on the anchors. Advised to form a system that goes over the back of your head rather than fastening it to your ears as it's uncomfortable. I use three rubber bands tied to each other with the band on the ends looping over the anchor hooks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n6markfuller\r\nUD-HensNest\r\nEveryone not sitting idle while 2% of the world's human population faces death.

In this case, adjust printer to match your optimal PLA temps (per manufacturer) and use same settings of .2mm layer height with a .4mm nozzle, 20% infil or increase walls to 4 walls and 10% infil.\r\n\r\nMask Filter Adapter - This is the inner adapter piece that holds the filtration fabric in place. Use regular PLA filament (or harder type) to ensure filter will remain secure inside the mask to ensure a good seal. PLA insert was printed with a 0.4 nozzle at approximately 210-215C with a layer height of 0.2mm.\r\n\r\nFiltration Fabric - EnviroCare HEPA cloth vacuum bags (synthetic / polypropylene material) 2000 series (or better can be used) were utilized which provide up to 99.97% filtration of particles up to 0.01 micron. Cut fabric to the shape of the Mask Filter Adapter with at least 15-20mm overlap to enable it to wrap inwards when securing the Mask and Filter Adapter together.\r\n\r\nAssembly - When assembling the mask, filter adapter, and fabric, simply lay mask on flat surface with inside of mask facing up. Align filtration fabric inside the mask to match the shape of the opening (where the filter adapter will go). Finally, carefully align the filter adapter (trying to keep the overlapping fabric even) and simply push filter adapter into place to secure fabric with a tight fit. \r\n\r\nStrap - Regular bungee-like cord was utilized however any strap can be used. Cord can be fastened with a knot like shown in the pictures.\r\n\r\nSilicone Tube - The following silicone tube was utilized to provide additional seal reinforcement:\r\nMcMaster-Carr Product #5236K506 High-Temperature Silicone Rubber Tubing for Air&water Soft, Durometer 35A, 1/8\" ID, 1/4\" OD, Opaque White, 25 ft. Length\r\n\r\nSimply cut the silicone tubing to match a length that will cover the surface area that will contact your face. Cut with a little excess to ensure a completed circle when fastened to the mask. With a small amount of superglue, fasten silicone tubing along the inside and very edge of the mask (see photos). go slowly to ensure tubing is straight and adhering to the mask with no gaps. When the silicone tube reaches end to end (completing the circle around the mask), cut the excess to complete the circle leaving a hairline or two extra to ensure the ends are snug to one another (naturally pressing into each other). A little drop of glue on the ends can also seal the deal! If there are any noticeable gaps where air seems to be escaping near the chin area, additional tubing can be cut (slit longways into a half-circle) and fastened on top of first tubing layer. \r\n\r\nAttribution Instructions \r\nPls credit Robins SPARK, Mercer University, and ATTC when applicable. \r\n\r\nReviewer Notes \r\nDear author,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your design to the NIH 3D Print Exchange.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou are receiving this message because your submission uses terminology that may not reflect the device function.

The primary impediment to an amateur printing a (SMELR Band) is the required use of Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE).

The design is optimized for rapid fabrication and durability. 12 full units per hour can be produced on a 60 watt CO2 laser platform. It is intended to be cleaned and reused as all parts are non-porous. The head band includes a nose piece to support the face shield, reducing the requirement for a tight fit. This means it is more comfortable over long peroids of usage. It does include an elastic or rubber band  rear closure to insure the face shield does not fall off, but it does not have to be as tight as designs without a nose piece. The nose pices can be removed if not desired. The Polypropylene (Copoly) frame is flexible, durable and forms well when bent. This allows for a very customizable and comfortable fit for the user.\r\n \r\nAlthough this design is intended for fabrication by laser cutting, the planar nature of the parts and can be easily produced by 3D printing or injection molding.\r\n \r\nProduct Point of View\r\nHealthcare workers responding to COVID-19 who face PPE (personal protection equipment) supply gaps while waiting for domestic face shield production to catch up with demand NEED a transparent face shield that:\r\n•\tlimits aerosol and splatter exposure from in front and above, while providing top ventilation\r\n•\treduces aerosol and splatter exposure on N95 and other face masks\r\n•\tis re-usable for a single user (can survive multiple daily washes; transparent visor can be replaced from readily sourced materials when worn out)\r\n•\tis easy to fabricate within a few days of design approval (ie no complex supply chains or production bottlenecks)\r\n•\tis comfortable to wear and easy to don and doff (as it will be taken on and off dozens of times in a twelve-hour shift)\r\n•\tprovides protection to broader area of face compared to standard safety goggles or glasses\r\nBill of Materials\r\n•\tSheet Polypropylene (Copoly) 3/16” thickness\r\n•\tFilm PET-G up to .016” thickness\r\n•\tElastic band, cord, or 3.5” rubber bands (2 per unit)\r\nInstructions for Use and Assembly\r\n1.\tLaser Cut 3 frame parts (frame, nose, and H-clip) from Polypropylene (CoPoly) and face shield from PET-G or similiar plastic.\r\n2.\tAttach face shield to headband on the four mounting pegs.\r\n3.\tAttach elastic to headband C-rings, adjust to fit.  Some users may find 1 3.5” rubber band is too tight, consider chaining elastic bands as necessary or using multiple rubber bands.\r\n4.\tTo clean, follow CDC recommendations in Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Eye Protection - Selected Options for Reprocessing Eye Protection. DO NOT submerge or soak 3D-printed headband in cleaning solution as the headband may absorb the solution and leak it out onto the wearer’s forehead over time.\r\n5.\tDiscard and replace the transparent visor as appropriate, after excessive wear or fogging.  \r\nFDA Notice on Emergency Response\r\nhttps://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/fda-efforts-connect-manufacturers-and-health-care-entities-fda-department-veterans-affairs-national\r\n \r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nSolidWorks 2019\r\nModel Origin \r\nCustom illustration/CAD\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nUniversal Laser Systems VLS4.60\r\nPrint Units \r\nmm\r\nPrinter-specific Build Instructions \r\nSpecific material \r\nPet- G film(face shield) (up to .016\" thick), Polypropylene (Copoly) sheet (3/16\" thck\r\nNumber of prints per build \r\n4\r\nBuild time \r\n7 minutes\r\nPre- and Postprocessing Instructions \r\nThe Polypropylene (Copoly) can have debris on the laser cut edge, make sure to scrape or sand before assembly.

Intended to replace regular surgical masks and respirators when these are unavailable or do not fit on tightly.\r\n\r\nThe halfmask can be assembled from common, commercially distributed materials. Its basic parts are 3D-printable (via FDM and other standard technologies). A tight touch on the face and full sealing of the mask walls are ensured by a sleeve that is made of a disposable glove (latex or nitrile). Only the glove material is in contact with the face therefore it is safe to use all common 3D printing materials (PLA, ABS, PETG, …) regardless their aproval for skin contact.\r\n\r\nAs custom-made hard plastic parts will never deliver the relaxed feeling and face adaptability of commercial soft plastic components, the utility value of our half mask closely relates to finding the right size. To satisfy the widest set of users, we designed multiple size variants including children’s options – a unique feature that exceeds commercially marketed products.\r\n\r\nMain features of BUTMASK-H2:\r\n\r\nFull sealing thanks to a convenient glove-made sleeve.\r\nFace skin contact only with the actual material of the disposable glove (Nitril or Latex) for improved safety.\r\nSleeve-protected mask structure reducing external contamination of the mask body and easing cleaning and disinfection.\r\nGood face shape adaptability (multiple sizes); with some materials (e.g. PLA) it is posiible to thermally adjust mask width.\r\nA low cost solution made of materials that are quick and cheap to change/replace and disinfect.\r\nMultiple adult sizes available: XL, L, M, S.\r\nChildren’s size options: XS, XXS.\r\nIndirect venting via lamellae to prevent particles and droplets from impinging directly on the filter’s material.\r\nExhaled air is filtered (no expiratory valve).\r\nFavorable effective inner volume (rather small dead space).\r\nDetailed User and Assembly Manual available for download.\r\nTo fabricate the halfmask, the following items are necessary:\r\n\r\nA 3D printer capable of delivering a product with the dimensions of 13 x 13 x 7 cm; most standard devices will meet the criterion.\r\nPrinting material (filament); generally, the requirements are very minimal, and the user can employ PLA, ABS, PET, PET-G, ASA, CPE, or any relevant alternative.\r\nAn highly elastic, disposable, L-sized glove; other sizes may find application too, although L embodies the ideal option. Nitril gloves are recommended thanks to their durability and overall strength; a latex sleeve is also convenient but offers less reliability and must not be used by persons allergic to the substance. Condoms are also usable if necessary.\r\nAn improvised filtering insert having a square-shaped size of at least 70 x 70 mm (version featuring 85 x 85 mm will be released soon).   Our preliminary tests show that a premium, high quality vacuum cleaner bag can function as a suitable improvised filtering medium. \r\nStrings, elastic rubber bands, or other material to form the headstraps.\r\nTwo thin rubber ribbons (cut out from, for example, an inner tube for bicycle wheels).\r\nOptional: a self-adhesive rubber sealing band (such as D-profile elements).\r\nA pair of scissors.\r\nMask shape adjustment\r\n\r\nWith many printing materials there is a possibility to perform small shape corrections in order to achieve good fit. In general, only the width of the mask can be adapted successfully. Therefore since the beginning the mask must suit the user in length, i.e. choosing the right size for printing is essential.\r\n\r\nTo adjust the shape (width), please follow the steps described in detail in the User and Assembly Manual.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Improved version where the filter area of the adult mask sizes is increased by almost 50% (from 70 x 70 mm to 85 x 85 mm) to reduce the pressure drop has been made available.

Face shields provide a physical barrier for the user against airborne droplets.\r\nSeveral open source face shield designs are available that can be produced rapidly by using inexpensive and distributed Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) plastic 3D printing for the visor together with polyethylene sheeting for the face protection.\r\nIn addition to health care professionals (HCPs), others that can benefit from access to face shields as a first line of defense include first responders, security personnel, and those working in essential customer service (grocery stores, pharmacies, and delivery services). The availability of 3D printed face shield designs for the general public can also ease the demand on traditional supply chains used by HCPs. \r\nThis is an open source design for a 3D-printed face shield visor that was iterated upon in order to improve producibility and speed to print. \r\n \r\nFeatures\r\n•\tFDM 3D prints without supports\r\n•\tUses three-hole punch size and spacing for each of assembly and replacement of polyethylene sheet\r\n•\tIncludes a brow guard to provide continuous coverage over the user's forehead\r\n•\tTwo methods of attaching elastic or string:\r\no\tHooking over tab\r\no\tLooping through hole\r\n \r\nLimitations\r\nA face shield does not substitute the use of an approved face mask.\r\nIn cases where approved masks are not available and a non-approved mask is used as a last resort, CDC guidance recommends use of a face shield in conjunction with the non-approved mask [2].\r\n[1] https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html\r\n[2] https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html\r\nModel Origin \r\nCustom illustration/CAD\r\nPrinter Technology/Material \r\nMaterial Extrusion\r\nPre- and Postprocessing Instructions \r\nFabrication\r\n•\t3D Printing\r\no\t0.3mm layer height\r\no\t30% infill\r\no\tPETG material\r\no\tPrint time ~ 2.5 hrs for one visor\r\n•\tPlastic Sheet\r\no\t0.15\" thickness\r\no\t9\" x 9\" square\r\no\tThree-hole punch on the top edge\r\no\tAlign the holes to the hooks and snap into place\r\n•\tElastic band\r\no\tCut to 11\" length\r\no\tMake a 3/4\" cut on either side to hook over tab\r\n•\tString \r\no\tCut to 11\"  length\r\no\tLoop through holes on either side and tie to secure\r\n•\tAttribution Instructions \r\n•\tmodeled by MITRE Corporation\r\n•\tReviewer Notes \r\n•\tThe following refers to: 3DPX-013406\r\n•\tThe FDA has authorized production of protective face shields outside of the normal clearance pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on Part 5, section D of the “Enforcement Policy for Face Masks and Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\" This face shield has undergone review in a clinical setting and is recommended when fabricated as instructed.\r\n\r\n"],

This reduces their efficacy. And constricts breathing.\r\n\r\nScrew on cap allows space for multiple stacking of filters and tight seal without any gaps.\r\n\r\nCurved facial edges make it more comfortable to wear for longer periods.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nThe wall thickness varies in order to maintain a horizontal constant of 3 print path shells/walls throughout.\r\nThis improves the integrity of the mask body, reducing gaps, print time & weight.\r\nAlmost the entire mask can be printed solid, just by increasing your wall/shell thickness to 5 or more. This will reduce any time for zigzag infill and keep smooth print paths which reduce vibration and gaps. For the single inner wall, you may need to adjust your print settings to allow for a smooth single extrusion.\r\nA mask with 2 shell walls is too fragile and leaves many gaps.\r\n\r\n70mm filter diameter is constant for all 5 mask sizes. Use 70mm gasket as template to easily trace out filter outlines before cutting.\r\n\r\nNo support needed. All surfaces do not exceed 45 degrees, except for curved facial edges and strap holder arches. But because of the size and curved shape of facial edges and strap holder arches, they do not require support either.\r\n\r\nOrganicly shaped strap loops keep print paths smoother and faster, reducing potential for gaps, vibration and material wastage on any corners.\r\n\r\nGlue, resin, paint, etc can be brushed onto the inside or outside of the mask to coat and seal off any visible and non-visible gaps.\r\nThis also provides a smoother surface which is easier to clean & dis-infect after usage.\r\n\r\nIf you want to print in a flexible filament, the star shaped filter grills may need to be thickened.

This device has not been tested to assess the out-gassing limits of the material or their corresponding health effects.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is my design for a re-usable face mask frame that could utilize a variety of filter media. This is NOT a respirator and does not claim to be, however, many design features were inspired by respirators. I welcome all feedback in the comments section to further iterate and optimize.\r\n\r\nIt consists of the following:\r\n\r\nA flexible liner from TPU/TPE designed to roll inward and conform to the face. In doing so it creates a much better seal than rigid shells and folded TPU sheet style designs. However, it won't be able to match super soft medical-grade silicone. Print with four top layers, 0% infill, and zero bottom layers for best results.\r\nRigid shell onto which everything mounts. The lip is intentionally oversized to create a seal between the liner and the shell. Grills require a printer capable of bridging 8mm.\r\nThe gasket/flap piece combining two functions to reduce complexity and parts count\r\nFilter media. Depends on what's locally available. I've tested this design with vacuum cleaner bags, cloth, and one third of a surgical mask.\r\nThe cover piece applies pressure to the gasket and forces the valve flaps against the exhaust openings. It also ducts exhaust to the rear. It should be printed in 100%TPU.\r\nStrap mounts designed to be modified for different configurations. They snap in place once the cover is added.  v5.2 is the latest.\r\nStraps - Refer to images to see the current configuration.  I used 550 cord sheath pieces of 1m, 500mm, and 500mm.  Create a loop in the 1m piece tied off with a square knot.  Attach the shorter pieces to the loop via lark's head knots.  Secure via the strap fitting part, adjust tension, and trim excess.\r\nThe usual caveats about printing this sort of device apply as testing has been limited. But all plastics used during prototyping survived my local hospital's H2O2 atomizing autoclave device, so it can be sterilized. My excellent medical provider and the local medical engineering team will continue to conduct further testing on plastics used to include more field expedient methods of sanitizing, porosity/liquid absorption, and oxygen flow/CO2 build-up with different filter media (though the one-way valves should help with the last). I also want to coordinate for a vapor spectrometer test to see if the printing process releases and VOCs in printed samples.  The AMF files should offer a complete set, since NIH decided to no longer allow STL uploads.\r\n\r\nI think this is about as complicated and feature-packed as one can go for a face mask producible on a consumer-grade printer using commonly available filaments. It requires about 6H total to print all parts, so production is not as scalable as I would prefer though it might present an interesting exercise in distributed manufacturing.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, safety considerations:\r\n-Use this design at your own risk...something something neither liable nor responsible...something something...\r\n-3D printed items can be porous and permeable\r\n-Recommend checking the SDS of whatever you print for particulates and hazardous volatile compounds\r\n-This will be an inferior/less desirable solution than similar parts from approved sources\r\n-Pretend that you have COVID-19 when moving the part from the print bed to a sealed container for delivery\r\n-I fly helicopters and ride motorcycles, so my perception of acceptable risk likely doesn't match yours or the FDA's.\r\n-Also, properly washing your hands for 20s and practicing disciplined social isolation will almost assuredly do more to improve your health outcomes than any mask you can buy or print. Don't risk compensate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Connor, Mr. Saesz of O2 Canada, the CCDC, ONR Tech Solutions, AFFOA, and the S&T Team for input and ongoing evaluation of this design.\r\n\r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nOpenSCAD\r\nModel Origin \r\nCustom illustration/CAD\r\n\r\nPrinter Technology/Material \r\nMaterial Extrusion\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nPrusa i3 MK3S\r\nPrint Units \r\nmm\r\nPrinter-specific Build Instructions \r\nSpecific material \r\nTPU/TPE for gasket/liner, PETG/ABS/PLA for the rest\r\nBuild time \r\n6H\r\n\r\nAttribution Instructions \r\nDesigned and prototyped by EB\r\n\r\nReviewer Notes \r\nThis device is a general purpose face mask intended for use in the community and is not suitable for use by a healthcare professional or in a healthcare facility or environment, as described in FDA Guidance Enforcement Policy for Face Masks and Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency, Section V B.

These masks do require the use of a filter which the person printing has to supply and the filter should be oversized when it is cut to help seal the mouth area.\r\n\r\nFilament: TPC/TPU at 95A Shore Hardness is suggested as a first choice and PETG as a second choice.\r\n\r\nAssembly: There are four parts to the full mask assembly (in order) -\r\n\r\n3D Printed mouth area / guard - this houses the filter and the laser cut acrylic piece and press fits onto either the Medium or Large mask\r\nLaser cut acrylic plate at 1/8 (3.2mm) thickness. Note* an STL is included of a version that can be printed if a laser cutter is not available. \r\nHEPA Filter. \r\n3D Printed Mask in either Medium or Large.\r\nNotes: The 3D Printed mouth area/guard is printed using one perimeter and 100% infill. The 3D Printed mask is a split process which prints the bottom, square area using one perimeter and 100% infill, and then the facial area itself is printed using spiral vase mode. Spiral vase mode is needed as it eliminates retraction, multiple perimeters, and creates a seamless print, which when combined with a 0.9mm nozzle, would generate a truly solid print. We suggest 1.50mm single wall pass when you start to print the area with the face. The spiral vase mode sequence should start at the 7.13mm layer height of either the Large or Medium model. Simplify3D is the only tested and suggest slicer to use for this. \r\n\r\nThis method of printing would yield the best chance, in our opinion, of creating an airtight 3D Print using FDM technology. The larger nozzle (0.9mm) and larger layer height (0.4mm) appears to increase bonding in the Z axis, making a stronger and more durable print. When assembled, using flexible filament, the TPC acts as a gasket; creating an air-tight assembly around the mouth and nose and ensure that ensuring that the wearer can breathe through the mask .\r\n\r\nTPC/TPU is the recommended filament.\r\n\r\nUsers have passed a FIT test using Bitrex or Saccharine.

You may not sell for profit but may accept donations to cover the costs of the supplies.\r\n\r\nI've calculated average cost per mask+filter to be $1.94\r\n$0.97 PLA + $0.12 3M filter + $0.31 MERV 13 filter + $0.25 glue + $0.29 tourniquet or elastic.\r\nAdditional Costs with processing and upgrades: Suggested upgrades include spraying 1 - 2 layers on the outside of the mask with clear acrylic ($0.08 per mask), adding window/door foam to the edge ($0.40), and adding a thin layer of silicone around the box-mask junction - just enough to seal it, but still be pulled apart if filter change is desired ($0.03). Additional cost = $0.51; TOTAL = $2.45\r\nIn these approximate calculations, I am not including cost of supplies such as sand paper, garbage bags, gloves, organic fume respirator, and wear and tear on machines.\r\n\r\nIf you wear this OVER a surgical mask for comfort and to filter the air an additional time in case any virus gets through cracks or micropores despite sealing the plastic, this would add another $0.58. Here in the hospital we have a few doctors experimenting with a layer of Halyard H600 between the mask and their face. One even put velcro to hold this layer along the inside of the mask. That stuff is featured in my other video, theoretically pushing this mask up to filtration numbers >99% though physics lab tests are pending. See other project:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVYypLYEo_0\r\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4262131\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThere are no guarantees about the efficacy of any home made masks. Use at your own risk. Get creative, stay safe. These are okay to use per CDC ONLY if you run out of other approved masks. Though the goal is to reach and exceed n95 level of filtration, this has not yet been confirmed. Testing is in progress will be updated with any findings. These are a last resort mask, considered equivalent to a scarf. You have to be the one to choose what you wear and I am not responsible for any negative outcomes if you choose to use this. The video and info here are for educational use only.\r\n\r\nCollaborations and Thank You's\r\n-Everett from Nevada - this guy helped me do at least 8 revisions of the mask. He is an incredibly talented 3D designer and offered to help me extensively without compensation, just to help us all make a difference in this fight against coronavirus. I had asked for help on youtube and he responded. I couldn't have done it without him. He is to thank for most of the improvements listed at the top. THANK YOU,\r\n\r\n-This is a remix of Kvatthro's thing #4222563, in that I started with some of his early files and modified them many times to get to where the designs are today. Kvatthro and I are finally connected and are friends. We video chat about design ideas frequently and share designs and concepts from across the world with each other. He is an incredible guy with a dedicated team in Slovenia. Please see his newest concept to use a ventilator circuit filter that provides over 99.99% filtration, holds pressure at 5 bar without leaks, and provides good saturation. The filter can be changed every 24 hours of use, and are affordable and accessible to hospitals.https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4242653\r\n\r\n-Thanks \"Igor & Pascal\" - from France comes a second strap loop model, now used as both attachment points\r\n\r\n-Please see the remixes - there is a gasket that can be printed from TPU though I have not tried, thanks mrdanielphelan\r\n\r\n-The idea for the square to hold the filter in place with minimal glue was sparked by Dr. Premkumar as well as the press-fit piece remix made by TheLastDunedain, thanks.\r\n\r\n-ABA-PGT with input from DaVinci and Medtronic for designing and injection molding the new filter box for us. - Bob Hazelton, the speed at which we are making these wouldn't be possible without you.

It was inspired by both The NanoHack by Copper3D and the DIY Face Mask by Mark Fuller. The HensNest has a flexible printed hoop frame that conforms to the face without post-processing steps, like using a heat gun or applying a sealant. The filter surface area is very large, addressing issues with the breathability of hard-sided mask designs with small filter towers, like The NanoHack. The HensNest adds a tented structure to the design that keeps the filter surface away from the mouth and nose, which we learned from our clinical collaborators is critical for keeping the filter dry and functional during extensive use. Lastly, this design is mostly planar and is fast and cheap to print. If you have design improvement suggestions, please post to the comments section below.\r\n \r\nRelease Notes for v2.0\r\nThe v2.0 HensNest design is production ready and includes complete assembly instructions. We are continuing to make minor tweaks to the design and will update these release notes as we progress.\r\n1.\tDESIGN MODIFICATIONS: HensNest v2.0 features two important design improvements from v0, namely, (a) an interior retaining ring that secures the filter in place; and (b) ergonomic improvements to the lofted wireframe to fit more comfortably around the nose while holding the filter material further from the face.\r\n2.\tFILTER MATERIAL: We have been experimenting with several commonly available filter materials, and our current recommendation is to use one ply of a (clean!) furnace filter. We recommend higher performance filters like 3M Filtrete Ultra Allergen Air Filters, which have an MPR rating of 1500. We are still in the process of respirator fit testing this design, and we will release these results as soon as they are available.\r\n3.\tSECUREMENT STRAPS: Current assembly instructions for HensNest v2.0 incorporate household rubber bands to secure the mask to the face. We present both a 4-point and 2-point securement option, with the 4-point being more strongly recommended. We recognize that comfort is a priority for longer duration use of the mask, and we are presently working on slight design modifications to improve the comfort of the securement straps.\r\n \r\nRelease Notes for v1.0\r\nWe released HensNest v1.0 to give the maker community a chance to further “hack” our improved wireframe design. We will continuously release design improvements and updates related to the wireframe design and all of the release notes listed below.\r\n1.\tASSEMBLY: Assembly for The HensNest is similar to the DIY Face Mask by Mark Fuller and involves first securing the disposable filter within the wireframe. Rubber bands or elastic straps should be connected at the four tabs on the wireframe to create two continuous loops around the head, similar to a disposable N95 mask design. We will release detailed assembly instructions and an assembly video very shortly.\r\n2.\tSTERILIZATION: The HensNest was designed with the intention of having a disposable filter (more on that in a sec) and a reusable wireframe. We recommend printing the wireframe in ABS to allow for both heavy disinfectant use and steam sterilization via hospital sterilizer or home dishwasher. If you’re printing in PLA/PETG, recognize that it will likely not be tolerant to steam sterilization but should not excessively degrade with bleach or alcohol disinfectants.\r\n3.\tFILTERS: Right now, we are experimenting with different filter types to achieve as close as possible to an N95 rating (knowing that we will not really achieve N95 rating). At present, we are testing vacuum cleaner bags, household heater air filters, and any other common filters we can get our hands on. We are fortunate to have an environmental safety and health officer at our institution who can run both qualitative and quantitative respirator fit tests. We will post these results as we get them. If you have suggestions for other filter types, please post to the comments section below.\r\n \r\nAbout the Team\r\nThe HensNest is a collaborative project from the University of Delaware’s (UD), home of the Blue Hens. The design was conceived and early prototypes manufactured in The Design Studio , which is an undergraduate teaching and learning makerspace in the UD Department of Mechanical Engineering. The project is led by Mr. Whitney Sample, Co-Director of The Design Studio and an industrial designer by training. Whitney has extensive experience in medical device design, and he “hacked” the HensNest design over the course of several long days in the Studio. Design and CAD support for the project was provided by Design Studio teaching assistant Arnav Prasad, with logistical support from faculty members Prof. Jenni Buckley and Prof. Ajay Prasad. Extensive clinical consultation and inspiration was provided by Dr. Lisa Lattanza, Chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Yale University and Co-Founder (with Prof. Buckley) of The Perry Initiative. The group would also like to thank Mike Gladle from UD environmental health and safety and all members of UD’s MakerNetwork and College of Engineering who helped with project logistics.\r\n \r\nLiability\r\nThe HensNest should be used only as a last resort when FDA-regulated masks are not available for home or medical use. At present, the HensNest has not been tested using either qualitative nor quantitative respirator fit tests. We will post these results as soon as they are available, along with our recommendations for filter materials. The HensNest design files and manufacturing notes are presented “as is” in a good faith effort by all parties to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. If you use, copy or share this Item, you agree to utilize these files for production of masks at your own risk and comply with any state and federal guidelines for use of these devices.

        "description":["Model ID \r\n3DPX-013885\r\nCategory Labware & Devices\r\nKeyword(s) PPE, face mask, corona, COVID-19, Coronavirus, Montana\r\nWe took the montana mask, found at makethemasks and changed the size to be smaller and the opening to be circular. This was for the purpose of N-99 filters that are 2\" and are used by allergist in a spirometer. We have also used the Rigid VF6000 filter vacs as well as the Filtrete 1500 and 1900 filters and cut into small squares. On the inside we have lined them with rubber window weather stripping for a tighter seal. What makes our unique is that if you have an allergist in town and can get access to the N-99 circular filters used by many of them, that our design was made for, then this is the best way to go. I have included a picture of the filter a well as the packaging.\r\n\r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nTinkercad/ Autodesk Fusion 360\r\n\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nDremel 3D40 and Dremel 3D45\r\nPrint Units mm\r\nScale At Given Print Units mm\r\n\r\nPrinter-specific Build Instructions \r\nSpecific material PLA\r\nNumber of prints per build 2\r\nBuild time 9 hours for two\r\n\r\nPre- and Postprocessing Instructions Instructions:\r\n\r\nYou can choose to print the small (118.82 mmx 98.53mm), the medium (122.79 mm x 101.79 mm) or the large (132.03mmx 109.47 mm), the gasket file is the same size for all three (51.50)\r\nThe most common size is the Medium.\r\nAfter you have your mask and gasket you will want to attach elastic . You can use 1/8\" or 3/8 \" depending on how thick you want your bands. I will put a picture of how I tie them on my post.\r\nNext you need to get rubber window seal, I use the Seal Weather Stripping White 52 feet/16m Epdm foam seal strip by Savina Anti-Collision Self Adhesive from Amazon. I peel off the back and press it around the inside rim of the mask andthen cut just a little tiny over to stick a drop of super glue and let it seal together. Again you can see this in my pictures.\r\nLast step is the filter. You can use several things. If you know an allergist these were designed with the 2\" circular front and gasket to hold an N-99 filter that allergists use in theor spirometers. They can buy these for you in bulk if you are interested. The other options are to use a Air filter and cut up squares. I have been using the Filtrete brand 1500 or higher. You can also use the Rigid VF 6000 shop vac filter and cut into squares it also collects 99.97 particles that are at least  .3 micron in size.\r\nYou can look at my pictures to see all of the above.\r\n\r\nDremel 3D40 Specifics: \r\n\r\nSlicing Profile: Standard PLA\r\n\r\nSupports: none\r\n\r\nLayer Height(mm): .2\r\n\r\nNumber of perimeters: 2\r\n\r\nBottom/top thick(mm) : .6\r\n\r\nInfill Density in: 25%\r\n\r\nBottom layer speed(mm/sec): 10 \r\n\r\nPrint speed(mm/sec) : 40 \r\n\r\nTraveling speed(mm/sec) : 110\r\n\r\nRetraction distance(mm) : 1.5\r\n\r\nTemperature & cooling\r\n\r\nExtruder(C) : 220\r\n\r\nCooling fan : yes\r\n\r\nFan speed min(%) : 100\r\n\r\nFan speed max(%) :100\r\n\r\nFan full on height(mm) : .2\r\n\r\nMinimal Layer Time(sec) :10\r\n\r\nPRINT TIME FOR TWO MEDIUM MASKS  AND TWO GASKETS: 9 hr 12 min\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDremel 3D45 Specifics: \r\n\r\nSlicing Profile: Experimental PLA\r\n\r\nSupports: none\r\n\r\nLayer Height(mm): .2\r\n\r\nNumber of perimeters: 2\r\n\r\nBottom/top thick(mm) : .8\r\n\r\nInfill Density in: 25%\r\n\r\nBottom layer speed(mm/sec): 10 \r\n\r\nPrint speed(mm/sec) : 40 \r\n\r\nTraveling speed(mm/sec) : 130\r\n\r\nRetraction distance(mm) : 1.5\r\n\r\nTemperature & cooling\r\n\r\nExtruder(C) : 220\r\n\r\nHeated Bed: 70\r\n\r\nCooling fan : yes\r\n\r\nFan speed min(%) : 100\r\n\r\nFan speed max(%) :100\r\n\r\nFan full on height(mm) : .2\r\n\r\nMinimal Layer Time(sec) :5\r\n\r\nPRINT TIME FOR TWO MEDIUM MASKS  AND TWO GASKETS: 9 hr 52 min\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNOTE: The above is using HATCHBOX PLA \r\n\r\nWhen I could not get HAtchbox I tried Geetech and Sunlu and for BOTH of these I had to reduce the extruder tempertaure to 210 as well as the treavling speed to 100!!!

As a collaboration between the Jeremy Ralston, Engineering Manager of the SLO Surgery Center, Cristian Sion, a Cal Poly Engineering student, and Clint Slaughter, MD, a local ER physician with Vituity, French Hospital ER, and SLO MakerSpace, we were able to bring the independent work we were each doing into a single project that remixes some other designs into a community mask alternative. \r\nWe have modified the Billings community mask model to include a larger filtration area for better airflow, an extended chin area, thinner walls to allow heat-molding to a user’s face, and added a cap similar to the LowellMakes mask to allow the entire mask to be sanitized between patients.  This provides a safe, effective, and locally producible way to markedly extend the supply of n95 masks.\r\nThis n95 holder is able to achieve subjective n95 fit testing on a wide variety of people, with the fit adjustable by heat molding and the installation of weatherstripping for comfort and an improved seal. This is not a NIOSH-approved device, but it functions as a holder for NIOSH-approved n95 material and we therefore consider this an extension of already approved equipment, which may allow for easier approval at your site.\r\nThe mask can be 3D printed on home machines, any elastic, rubber band, or similar can be used for straps, and either properly handled used n95 respirators or new n95 disposable respirators can be used to make 1-4 SLOR masks.\r\n \r\nedits from Natronwong \r\n \r\nSummary\r\nInstead of printing the full mask only to find out it doesn't fit you well, print these different \"sizes\" to try out. The original mask can be scaled in the X and/or Y planes to get a perfect fit for you. For example, I found that if I scaled it to 90% in just the \"nose to chin\" dimension then it was a perfect seal for me.\r\nThe sizes I uploaded called 100%, 90%, and 80% are scaled in both X and Y dimensions. The size called 90% wide is only scaled down in the \"nose to chin\" dimension. The width is the same as the original. This was a perfect fit for me personally.\r\nAlternatively, you can use this Mask Rim over a surgical mask to enhance the fit and seal of a basic surgical mask.\r\nSegmentation Software \r\nCura/QIDI\r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nAutodesk Fusion 360\r\nModel Origin \r\nBillings MT REMIX\r\nExternal Derivative Source \r\nBillings Mt Mask\r\nMedical Application \r\nActive and Wearable Devices›Other\r\n \r\nGeneral Equipment›PPE and safety accessories\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nQIDI x-Plus\r\nPrint Units \r\nmm\r\nScale At Given Print Units \r\n100%\r\nPrinter-specific Build Instructions \r\nSpecific material \r\nPLA or TPU- TPU for best results and flexibility\r\nNumber of prints per build \r\n1\r\nBuild time \r\n2.5hr-6hr\r\nPre- and Postprocessing Instructions \r\nPrint Settings:\r\nWe used these settings as well as the default settings on a Creality 10S Pro and a Lulzbot Taz6, respectively, adjust to your printer.\r\nNote: scale down to 90-92% if small face structure;\r\n \r\nQDI X-Plus\r\nLayer height- 0.3                     Print speed- 80 mm/s\r\nLayer width- 0.4                      Travel speed- 100 mm/s\r\nWall line count- 2                    Printing Temp- 215C\r\nTop layer- 4                          Bed Plate- 50C\r\nBottom Layer- 4\r\nInfill- 15%\r\nAssembly:\r\n1.\ttake the holder and use the 300 grit sandpaper and smooth the inside about a ½” inside the mask.

Use at your own risk. Educational purposes only: Files are here: thingiverse.com/thing:4262131 This tutorial shows how to make a high filtration mask from blue surgical tray material called Halyard H600, though doing so is not endorsed by the company or guaranteed. This is an adaptation of a mask sewn from this material detailed by Dr. Bruce D Spiess. It has been claimed that both 1 and 2 layers filter over 99% of small particles, implying it is better than n95, but this testing to confirm is underway. Above all else, the most important aspect is a good seal, which this mask strives to create. See Dr. Spiess' sewing tutorial: https://ufhealth.org/news/2020/uf-hea... To apply to 3D printing instead of sewing, we call this the \"CEG Extreme\". What we did at the Musculoskeletal Institute at UConn was to adapt a face frame to allow 1 or 2 layers of this material to be pressed to your face. You can use elastics or IV/phlebotomy tourniquets cut into 1/3's. Pre-tie the knots and slide into three slots. Tie addition knots to increase tension as needed. The final knot locks in like floss between teeth and avoids the need to pull over the head. Print with 100% infill.

All of the components(including the elastic band) can be injection molded.. This has passed design review by Protolabs as an injection moldable design. We have not ordered injection molded components and have done our validation only against FDM printed versions out of PLA. We recommend ordering a sample run to validate the design before ordering a large volume run. Before ordering from Protolabs, we recommend contacting them as they will have these designs on file.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n A variant of this design is printable on FDM  and can be more easily stacked than the original DtM design in a print envelope is also included in this submission. It removes some of the locating features need in the IM design and simplifies the build process.

A nasal swab must be able to collect sufficient sample material from a patient for accurate PCR testing. Therefore, the design of the nasal swab head must have a sufficient surface area and absorption capability. However, these design features should not come at the cost of creating nasal mucosal abrasions that cause bleeding (epistaxis). Clinical analysis estimates that the likelihood of abrasion injury during normal use occurs when the swab is rotated during sample collection. This method provides an objective measure of the potential nasal swab abrasion resulting from swabbing. The test method consists of rotating a single nasal swab against a foam block under constant load, comparable to the pressure required for clinical swabbing. It is not intended to be an indicator of a safe or unsafe nasal swab, but rather to provide feedback on the abrasive quality of the swab. Data obtained from this test is intended to be followed up with a formal clinical trial during less critical times to establish safety and efficacy.\r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nSolidworks\r\nModel Origin \r\nCustom illustration/CAD\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nLASER cutter or Water Jet\r\nPrint Units \r\nmm\r\nPre- and Postprocessing Instructions \r\nDownload DWG files for LASER cutter or Waterjet.

We have also made the following safety improvements (see photos for details):\r\n1.\tWe increased the height of the front face holding the mounting pegs to eliminate the risk of the transparency forming a splatter-gutter at the base of the visor.\r\n2.\tWe closed the sides of the visor to create improved protection against aerosol and splatter from above.\r\n3.\tWe increased the spacing of the gap between the inner and outer headband segments to make it easier to wipe the entire surface clean between patients\r\n \r\nOther design modifications are intended to adapt the design to production at scale via injection molding: adding gate recesses, and increasing draft angles and adding ejector pin bosses for ejecting the part out of the mold.  These features have no effect on the function of the 3d-printed part.\r\n \r\nThis design has been testing in clinical settings and reviewed by infection control experts, who have rated the design as functionally equivalent to the DtM-v3.0 and DtM-v3.1 (no logo) designs.\r\n \r\nFor access the full, open source, turnkey face shield design package from Design that Matters and Spark Health Design including updated, open source, editable instructions for use, and advice on labeling, packaging, regulatory, and quality systems to enable new manufacturers to quickly scale face shield production, see the DtM-v4 Turnkey Package for High Volume Manufacture (Google Archive).\r\n \r\n \r\nProduct Point of View\r\nHealthcare workers responding to COVID-19 who face PPE (personal protection equipment) supply gaps while waiting for domestic face shield production to catch up with demand NEED a transparent face shield that:\r\n \r\n•\tLimits infectious aerosol and liquid splatter from in front and above, while still providing top ventilation to limit fogging, and enabling the HEADBAND FRAME to flex slightly to the head.\r\n•\tReduces infectious aerosol and liquid splatter on N95 and other face masks.\r\n•\tCan be used for multiple uses by a single user (easy to clean, can survive multiple daily wipe-downs; transparent visor can be easily replaced when worn out).\r\n•\tCan be rapidly assembled to limit time healthcare practitioners spend in preparing and cleaning face shields.\r\n•\tIs comfortable to wear (inner band accommodates microfoam surgical tape)\r\n•\tIs easy to don and doff (as it will be taken on and off dozens of times in a 12-hour shift).\r\n•\tProvides protection to a broader area of face compared to safety goggles or glasses.\r\n•\tHas no moving parts: in designing medical devices for low-resource settings, DtM learned that moving parts are the first to break.\r\n \r\nBill of Materials\r\nThis face shield consists of three (3) components: the HEADBAND FRAME, the TRANSPARENT SHIELD, and the HEADBAND STRAP.\r\n \r\nHEADBAND FRAME: The Headband Frame could be made of a variety of injection molded or cast materials that provide some flexibility to conform to the head, are resistant to typical hospital cleaners, and are durable during drops. Polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) are two possibilities. \r\n \r\nTRANSPARENT SHIELD: This face shield is designed to be compatible with an extra-large TRANSPARENT SHIELD as well as a standard US Letter-sized report cover (or similar transparent sheet) that can be attached and secured by using the geometry found in a standard 3-hole punch. Options include polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene.  \r\n \r\nThe Transparent Shield could be made with a variety of clear materials. If using off-the-shelf US-Letter clear report covers, the following options are recommended:\r\n•\tGBC ClearView Presentation Covers (polypropylene) (P/n: GBC 2000041) \r\n•\tAvery (P/n: 16741) \r\n•\tOffice Depot Binding Covers (polypropylene) (P/n 459-207)\r\n \r\nHEADBAND STRAP: Recommend an elastomer that is Shore A 40-60 material, and also resistant to typical hospital cleaners. Options include latex-free silicone rubber and Teknor Apex resins TDS Monoprene PR-23040 and Monoprene CP-28350.\r\n \r\nInstructions for Use and Assembly\r\n \r\nFrom the EPA guidelines in List N: Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-agai...), it is recommended to use the following four solutions when following the Recommended Cleaning procedures of the face shield. These four solutions have been tested with the face shield when built with materials polypropylene and silicone rubber (non-latex). The following list is in preferential order.\r\n \r\n1. Super Sani-Cloth\r\n2. 10% chlorine bleach solution (*May fog TRANSPARENT SHIELD over time)\r\n3. CaviWipes\r\n4. Soap and water\r\n \r\nVisit the \"Extras\" tab to view the Quality Control (QC) Testing reports. If selecting alternative materials, follow the QC procedure for testing with disinfectants to identify typical hospital cleaners compatible with the face shield. Provide the updated list of cleaners to users in the editable instructions for use.\r\n \r\nWe are always learning. For the most updated, editable copy of the instructions for use, please visit this link to the Google Drive archive.\r\n \r\nFDA Emergency Use Authorization for Face Shields for Medical Use\r\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/136842/download\r\n \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThis design is a remix from the Prusa Protective Face Shield - RC2.

This device has not been tested to assess the out-gassing limits of the material or their corresponding health effects.\r\n \r\n*** Updates coming ***\r\nWe hope to expand our filter and cleaning options.  Please check this site for updates.\r\n******\r\n \r\nThe Stopgap Face Mask was created as an emergency action in an effort to protect people by providing backup PPE options if the standard PPE has become unavailable. This device has not gone through the same regulatory approval process as standard PPE.\r\n \r\nThe Stopgap Face Mask consists of two main components (the mask body and the filter cover) and contains features for attaching two elastic straps and receiving a patch of filter material.  It is recommended that the rectangular filter patch and elastic straps are disposed of after every use of this device. The remaining parts of the plastic mask can be disinfected using common disinfecting solutions or sterilized and reused.\r\nRevision B of the Stopgap Surgical Face Mask includes the following improvements:\r\n•\tImproved breathability\r\no\tReduced internal volume to minimize recycled air\r\no\tLarger filter area to reduce pressure drop\r\n•\tImproved fit\r\no\t3 sizes now available (small, medium, large)\r\no\tAll sizes have changed to improve fit (check to see if the best fit size has changed for you)\r\no\tFlange near face reduced to improve mask flexibility\r\no\tMask angles changed to reduce hard edges in contact with face\r\n•\tImproved cover snap – better retention and easier to remove\r\n \r\nFor Revision A, see model 3DPX-013429\r\n \r\nMany people contributed to

Designers are Dr. Gregory W. Vogl and Dr. Kamel S. Saidi from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This novel design combines a 3D printed shell, filter square and retainer to produce a complete mask. The design utilizes two sizes (large and small) to cover a wide variety of face shapes and sizes.\r\n\r\nThe EveryMask is a reusable 3D-printed mask that accepts a square piece of almost every type of filter material and can be printed with almost every plastic on every 3D printer while forming a seal with almost every type of face. The face mask is composed of three 3D-printed parts (Shell, Square, and Retainer), FDA-approved foam, elastic strapping, and a filter square. Only the FDA-approved foam is touching the skin for long-term use; the 3D-printed parts do not touch the user’s face. Since the plastic material of the EveryMask is not in direct contact with the user’s skin, the 3D-printable parts may be made from most plastic materials. Also, the FDA-approved foam forms a proper seal to faces of various shapes and sizes; the EveryMask is a true respirator.\r\n\r\n3D Modeling/CAD Software \r\nSolidworks\r\nModel Origin \r\nCustom illustration/CAD\r\n\r\nPrinter Technology/Material \r\nAcrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)\r\nPrinter Make/Model \r\nAny FDM printer should work\r\nPrint Units \r\nmm\r\nScale At Given Print Units \r\n1:1\r\nPrinter-specific Build Instructions \r\nSpecific material \r\nABS to allow for Autoclave sterilization\r\n\r\nAttribution Instructions \r\nDesigners of the EveryMask:\r\n\r\nGregory W.
